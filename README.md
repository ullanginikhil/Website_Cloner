# Website_Cloner
This Website Cloner and Crawler is a Python-based tool that allows users to crawl a website, download all its HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files, and save them into organized folders on the local machine. The tool is designed to recursively traverse all internal links within the domain, ensuring that the entire site structure is cloned.
